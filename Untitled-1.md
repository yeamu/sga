# [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) 
React is JavaScript library for building user interface
* **Declarative**:React makes it painless to create interative Uls.Design 
simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently 
update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declaraative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Comoponent-Based**:Build encapsulated components that managge their
state, then  compose them to make complex Uls. Since component logic is
written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data

# [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) 
React is JavaScript library for building user interface
* **Declarative**:React makes it painless to create interative Uls.Design 
simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently 
update and render just the right components when your data changes.
Declaraative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Comoponent-Based**: Build encapsulated components that managge their
state, then  compose them to make complex Uls. Since component logic is
written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data
through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions avout the rest
of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React
without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using
Node dan power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

### Installation
React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need:**
* Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get taste of React.
* [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one miute.
* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript
toolchain.
You can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a `react` package on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).
### Documentation
You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://reactjs.org/).
check out the [Getting Started]() page for a quick overview.
The documentation is divided into several sections:
* [Tutorial]()
* [Main Concepts]()
* [Advanced Guides]()
* [API Reference]()
* [Where to Get Support]()
* [Contributing Guide]() 
You can improve it by sending pull reqyests to [this repository]().
### Examples
We have several examples [on the website](). Here is the first one to get you
started:
```js
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
    return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById)('containet'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Talor" />;)
```
### Contributing
The main pupose of this repository is to contiue evolving React core, making
it fater and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on
GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and 
improvements. React below learn how you can take part in improving React.
